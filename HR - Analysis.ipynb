    "A human resource department wants to understand the relationships between different variables that might influence employee satisfaction or turnover. The HR department is interested in understanding the association between the department in which employees work and their participation in a new workplace wellness program. The HR team has compiled this data over the past two years and has asked your assistance to check if there's any significant association between an employee's department and their enrolling in the wellness program."
